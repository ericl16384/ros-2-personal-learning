Goal:
- Set up layered control system nodes (or at least one or two basic layers)


`ros2 interface list`
`ros2 interface list | grep std_msgs`
`ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`

`ros2 topic list -t`
`ros2 topic info /your/topic/name`

`ros2 service list -t`


I'm trying to send acceleration commands. But now as I write this, I realize I should instead
use topics to indicate the location of each of the physical components, and let each physics sim
node subscribe to the position of other nodes. The goal position can also be a msg publish-subscribe.

Turns out I don't need services, but I suppose now I have read a little into the matter.
