goals for today
- [ ] clamp acceleration of drivetrain/arm
- [ ] use tf frames to communicate local goals from the drivetrain to the arm
- [ ] (my physics sim) apply equal and opposite acceleration to arm head (payload) when the drivetrain is accelerating

decisions
- I think I may want to use the same type of node for the drivetrain and arm control
    - the arm and drivetrain can inherit from this reactive control node
- how should the high level commands be propogated down through the ranks?
    - 




issues/bugs
- [x] zombie nodes sometimes still exist after I kill the launch terminal (see pkill)





```bash

ros2 launch layered_control_systems arm.launch.py

pkill -f ros2

```






node structure (from my slides)
- A chain of command system of control nodes
E.g. from lowest to highest: arm control, drivetrain control, payload direction, routing, (collision avoidance,) fleet commander, (pathfinding,)
- Each node of the chain of command will do its best to obey the direction of its overseeing node, but when that is impossible/unsafe, will take alternative action, and relay this updated status to the overseeing node





notes for meeting with Dr. Rastgoftar
- I really want to learn:
    - read/write data between Gazebo and Ros2
    - how to do better visualizations (so I can dev easier)
        - plot data (like Serial plotter from Arduino)
        - how to store complex data that can be accessed from other nodes (e.g. position history)
- 20 hours per week? Am I to keep to exactly that number?
    - What are the minimum hours per week
- physical robot setup
    - are the arms (and drivetrain) backdrivable?
        - I think that is essential for my proposed method



future learning
- see notes for meeting with prof
- how to instantiate nodes with specific arguments (e.g. max accel, max vel)


next steps
- make these notes into a Google Doc for easier writing and viewing
- set up alias for cd/build/source
