After resuming ros2 work after about 36 hours, my VSCode window would not load files
Therefore, I used `wsl --shutdown && wsl`
That did not resolve the problem, so I spent two hours learning about containers
- (I loaded the containers from inside WSL and also from Windows)

(I also learned about `git branch -a` which allows you to see origin branches)

Then commands inside containers were slow, so I am returning back to default WSL

- It didn't work out of the box, but when I removed "workspaceFolder", "workspaceMount", "mounts", and "postCreateCommand" it worked



Takeaways:
- Close vscode editor windows when I close my computer
  - That is, when Windows sleeps
  - If I use hibernate, it might fare better?





Next steps:
- Clone existing ground robot project instead of trying to make my own from scratch (that is what I will be doing in the lab anyways for the first little bit)
- Program the robot to do simple maneuvers: drive in rectangle, star
- Update robot URDF to approximate the mecanum drive
- Refactor to have separate nodes do routing, driving, motor control
- Update to include finer grain controls
    - Heading
        - Point to target, then drive
        - Point to target, then drive, with course correction
        - Strafe to target
        - Turn to face target while strafing to target
    - Forward (turn, move to point, no error correction en route)
    - Forward w/ course correction (correct angle of approach while moving by using tank drive)
    - Strafe (no turning, just mecanum strafe)
    - Fixed radius arc mode (move while turning use rectilinear method)
    - etc.

Big questions:
- What is the fastest way to move (and turn) a mecanum from point to point?
    - How do the forward and strafing behaviors of mecanum differ? (Acceleration, top speed)
- What mathematical systems can be used to describe the approach of the vehicle?
    - Critically damped oscillator is my first best guess
        - Idea: Max acceleration being, say, 75% of capability, in order to still remain responsive

Endgame strategy:
- Top-level payload kinematic commands, which then are pursued by the following methods:
    - Coarse movements by drive system
        - Some combination of mecanum strafing and rotate to face direction of travel
        - Sequential process:
            - (note that critically damped approach will need to factor in relative velocity somehow)
            <!-- - a_dest = Calculate acceleration to target destination -->
            - Recieve a_dest = acceleration to target
            - a_payload = Calculate acceleration to payload relative position, velocity
            - bias = non linear interpolation [0, 1] based on distance to payload
                - Alternate: based on relative magnitude of a_dest and a_payload
                - (in order to catch off-course or slow/fast payload)
            - a_result = Interpolate a_dest and a_payload based on bias
            - Send a_result to drive system
            <!-- - Interpolate between correction and command signals based on priority (obstacle, far off-center, etc) -->
    - Reactive adjustments by stepper arms (like steadicam system)
        - If not able to react fast enough, signal drive system to strafe under the payload
            - This allows it to handle harsh perturbations, as well as to simply soften excessive drive commands
- Assumptions:
    - Level, obstacle free, textured ground surface
    - Acceleration response time is negligible

Technical questions
- Are the arms free to rotate continuously, or do we need to maintain specific vehicle headings?
- What connection do the arms have to the payload: socket or fixed?
    - If connections are fixed, how does this impact our strategy?

Speculation on prior work
- At first I was very suprised that a four vehicle system would be harder than a three vehicle system. My idea is that fixed connections between the arms and the payload will result in the payload being over-constrained, putting excess (unexpected at the very least) strain on the stepper motors. Pin connections would not have this issue?
