goal for today:
- [x] make target position a topic, so that I can write to it from the command line
- [x] implement movement damping (kinematics)
- [x] write a node to give the arm head random places to move
- [ ] constrain acceleration of head
- [x] implement drivetrain tf
  - [ ] local vs global space (global commands w/ local movements)
- [ ] set up Gazebo


```bash

ros2 launch layered_control_systems arm.launch.py

ros2 run layered_control_systems publish_random_arm_target_positions --ros-args -r "__ns:=/vehicle_1"


ros2 topic pub --once /vehicle_1/arm_head_target_pos geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3Stamped "vector: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}"


```



other stuff
- did a little reading on Gazebo mecanum packages



future steps
- dynamically measure the mass/intertia of the payload/arm system
