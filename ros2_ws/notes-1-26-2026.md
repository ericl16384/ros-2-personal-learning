goal for today:
- make target position a topic, so that I can write to it from the command line
- implement movement damping (kinematics)


```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /vehicle_1/arm_head_target_pos geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3Stamped "vector: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}"
```


future steps
- dynamically measure the mass/intertia of the payload/arm system
