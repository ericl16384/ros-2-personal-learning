goal for today:
- [x] make target position a topic, so that I can write to it from the command line
- [x] implement movement damping (kinematics)
- [x] write a node to give the arm head random places to move
- [ ] constrain acceleration of head


```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /vehicle_1/arm_head_target_pos geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3Stamped "vector: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}"


ros2 run layered_control_systems publish_random_arm_target_positions --ros-args -r "__ns:=/vehicle_1"
```


future steps
- dynamically measure the mass/intertia of the payload/arm system
